# Command line basics

If you have not used command line interfaces frequently, here is a refreshing sip of how they work.

## Terminals

Web applications run in Web browsers, command line applications run in terminals.

### Mac OS X

Mac users can open `Terminal.app` with `Spotlight -> Terminal`.

### Windows

Windows users can open `Command Prompt` by launching `Start -> Run -> cmd`.

### Linux

Linux distributions often offer a terminal such as `xfce4-terminal`, `gnome-terminal`, `konsole`, or `xterm`. Graphical Linux distributions often provide a global desktop hotkey for launching terminals: `Control+Alt+T`.

## Prompts

Once a terminal is open, the user is prompted to enter syntax for interacting with command line programs. Unix-based OS's tend to provide a dollar sign prompt (`$`), whereas Windows provides a greater than prompt (`>`).

In any case, this is the terminal's way of asking the user to input some commands. For example, the next section instructs the user to type a command into the terminal that will download and install LFTP. This manual uses `monospace` to indicate that text should be copied & pasted, or otherwise input in a terminal in order to be used.
